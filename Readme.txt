These applications have both a server part and a client part. File transfer uses Server-Client architecture to move file contents from client to server.

Description:
The Client starts by checking the server status on a particular port. If the server is up, the client and server will form a logical connection which shall be used to transfer the file contents. 
The Java server will bind to port 55555, while C++ server will bind to 55556.

Objectives:
•Create a file transfer application in C++.
•Create a file transfer application in Java.
•TCP is used as at transport layer to establish reliable connection.
•Use message passing to establish an application level logical connection between the server and the client.
•Transfer the file contents.
